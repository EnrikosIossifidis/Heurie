Option 1:
Assign first house to first battery until capacity of the battery is reached

Option 2:
Assign randomly, taking max. cap. into account

Option 3:
Iterate over houses, assign house to closest battery unless max. cap. is reached

Option 4:
Rank all distances, assign from smallest to largest that are still available

Option 5:
Rank all houses on their ranges of options(batteries), assign the connection to the best option 
for that house starting from widest range


Another thought:
Can we make a visualisation of the network (both graphs and spatial?)
